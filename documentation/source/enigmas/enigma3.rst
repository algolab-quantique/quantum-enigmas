=======================================
Enigma 003 : The Four-Square Chessboard
=======================================

Alice and Bob continue their journey in space. They are challenged by AÃ¯ka, who's hidden a key under one of the four chessboard squares. A coin is then randomly placed on each of the four squares. How will Alice communicate to Bob the exact position of the key by flipping only one coin? You will apply a new concept, the control by the 0-state.

The enigma uses a modulo two addition like this one:

    <style>
        .center {
            margin-left: 45px
        }
        .equation.stacked {
            display: inline-block;
        }
        .equation.stacked .number {
            display: block;
            margin-left: 1em;
            text-align: right;
        }
        .equation.stacked .operator {
            float: left;
        }
        .equation.stacked .equals {
            display: block;
            height: 0;
            border-bottom: solid 1px black;
            overflow: hidden;
        }
        div {
            margin-bottom: 1em;
        }
    </style>
    <div class="center">
        <div>
            <span class="equation stacked">
                <span class="number">1 0</span>
                <span class="operator">+</span>
                <span class="number">0 1</span>
                <span class="equals">=</span>
                <span class="number">1 1</span>
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

Such addition has the interesting characteristic that the numbers can be interchanged in any order like this

.. raw:: html

    <div class="center">
        <div>
            <span class="equation stacked">
                <span class="number">1 1</span>
                <span class="operator">+</span>

                <span class="equals">=</span>
                <span class="number">1 0</span>
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

Or

.. raw:: html

    <div class="center">
        <div>
            <span class="equation stacked">
                <span class="number">1 1</span>
                <span class="operator">+</span>

            </span>
        </div>
    </div>

Meaning that adding any two of them gives the third one as an answer (this is true for any numbers). Playing with modulo two additions also has other interesting characteristics. In the enigma, adding the first number to the second is done by applying a CNOT between *q*\ :sub:`4`\  and *q*\ :sub:`6`\  (and *q*\ :sub:`5`\  and *q*\ :sub:`7`\). Here is the code of the algorithm in the enigma.

What is the value on q6 after such an operation?

    |  Q6 now has the answer to the modulo two addition between q4 and q6.
    |
    |  An extra qubit would be needed to have the answer to the modulo two addition
    |            between q4 and q6.
    |  No addition has been performed between q4 and q6.
    |
    |  The CNOT does not permit to perform modulo two additions.

**Question 2 : Write the circuit for a 4 by 4 square chess**

Can you write the circuit for a 4 by 4 square chess set until you calculate the position of the piece to turn?

*HINT 1*

Start by drawing a 4 by 4 chess board and number each square from 0 to 15 in decimal and binary numbers starting with the top row.

*HINT 2*

The trick is now to add (modulo 2) all the squares that end with a 1 and to proceed the same way with all squares that have a 1 on their second bit counting from right to left and so on using four extra squares.

*HINT 3*

Provide the drawing of Hint 2 with the arrows for the counting

    #qubits 0 to 15 are the 16 squares
